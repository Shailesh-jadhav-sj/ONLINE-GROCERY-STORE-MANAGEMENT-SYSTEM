The objective of this project is to develop an online grocery store where any grocery products
can be bought from the comfort of home through the Internet. This system will be a mediator
between distributors and customers.
The system is divided into two parts :
 The data of distributors and branches handled by them and stock availability is
collected.
 The products are displayed to customers according to the availability, and data related
to their orders is stored.
There are three roles available :
 Admin
 Distributor
 Customer
